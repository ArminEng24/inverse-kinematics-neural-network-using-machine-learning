# Inverse Kinematics Neural Network Using Machine Learning

## Description
This project implements a neural network to solve the inverse kinematics problem for a two-joint planar manipulator. The neural network is trained to predict the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector position.

## Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these libraries using pip:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn

## Usage
**Initialize the Arm Object:
Python

a = arm()
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
Train the Neural Network: The code defines various hyperparameters and trains the neural network with different configurations. You can run the notebook to see the training process and results.
Plot the Arm Configuration:
Python

a.plot_arm()
AI-generated code. Review and use carefully. More info on FAQ.
