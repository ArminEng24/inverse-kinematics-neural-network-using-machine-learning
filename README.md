# Inverse Kinematics Neural Network Using Machine Learning

## Description

This project implements a neural network to solve the inverse kinematics problem for a two-joint planar manipulator. The neural network is trained to predict the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector position.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
